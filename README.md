# d-IO-file, a Stata Dofile I/O Detector

A primitive regEx based Python program which detects inputs and outputs to Stata do files and produces a .txt output.

## Usage

Run the executable `d-IO-file.exe` by clicking on it or by typing `.\d-IO-file.exe` on the command line. Alternatively, if you have python installed, you can run `python d-IO-file.py`.

Follow the prompts to input a target directory of dofiles (the search is recursive and this can contain subdirectories), and a file name for the desired location of output (without the extension).
