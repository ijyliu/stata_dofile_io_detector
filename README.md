# Stata Dofile I/O Detector
A primitive regEx based Python program which detects inputs and outputs to Stata do files.

## Versions
The A version is the main, most up-to-date and supported version.
The B version is centered around an experimental feature which attempts to name files with the longest available path, which was determined to be less useful and even detrimental for the initial project motivating development.
